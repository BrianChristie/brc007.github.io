      <description>Recently I typeset an academic thesis in LaTeX. Because LaTeX is so old, a ton of the advice online is conflicting or outdated. Here’s my notes on what worked well in May 2017. I highly recommend the excellent ShareLaTeX documentation pages to get started. Also the LaTeX WikiBook is very helpful.
Before starting, ask around in your department to see if anyone has a LaTeX file that’s already setup to meet the requirements of your graduate college.</description>
